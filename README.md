# Frontend Mentor - Four card feature section

![Design preview for the Four card feature section coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges allowed me to improve my skills in a real-life workflow.

**To do this challenge, you need a basic understanding of HTML and CSS.**

## The challenge

My challenge was to build on this feature section and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

I am to use any tools i like to help me complete the challenge in which i just used the basic languages such as HTML and CSS.

My Viewers/users should be able to view the layout for the site depending on their device's screen size

i was able to get some support on the challenge from the [Slack community](https://www.frontendmentor.io/slack) and ask questions in the **#help** channel where necessary

 ## Where to find everything

The task of building the project was made quite easy as i was able to find a folder which containes both the mobile and the desktop version of the design to work with.

the designs were in JPG static format. This means i had to train my eyes to perceive differences in spacing and size as i use my best judgement in styling.


## Building your project


## Deploying your project

There are a number of ways to host projects for free. [Vercel](https://bit.ly/fem-vercel) was recommend using  as it's amazing service is simple to get set up with. Here is some steps to follow to get started:

1. [Sign up to Vercel](https://bit.ly/fem-vercel-signup) and go through the onboarding flow, ensuring your GitHub account is connected by using their [Vercel for GitHub](https://vercel.com/docs/v2/git-integrations/vercel-for-github) integration.
2. Connect your project to Vercel from the ["Import project" page](https://vercel.com/import), using the "From Git Repository" button and selecting the project you want to deploy.
3. Once connected, every time you `git push`, Vercel will create a new [deployment](https://vercel.com/docs/v2/platform/deployments) and the deployment URL will be shown on your [Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard). You will also receive an email for each deployment with the URL.

However, i used Netlify.com.

## Sharing your solution

There are places i shared my solution:

1. It was submitted on the platform so that other users will see my solution on the site.
2. I also shared my solution page in the **#finished-projects** channel of the [Slack community](https://www.frontendmentor.io/slack).
3. I tweet [@frontendmentor](https://twitter.com/frontendmentor) and mention **@frontendmentor** including the repo and live URLs in the tweet.
